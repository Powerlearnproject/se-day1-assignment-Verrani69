Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of softwares. Software engineering enables the creation of software applications and systems that we interact with daily such as communication, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C)
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline
The advent of structured programming

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - gather data on user needs and system requirements
Design - create what the user needs ensuring it follows UX/UI canons
Implementation - writing code and building code software code according to user specifications\
Testing - inspecting the software incase it has bugs or not functioning fully
Deployment - releasing the software to the users after testing and ensuring no bug is present
Manintenance - working on the system to ensure it works optimally

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall - creating a software with specific phases to follow e.g building the main pages of a website such as home, about, service
Agile - this is an interactive approach where it's based on flexibility, collaboaration, and making changes e.g a graphic design project where various people collaborate

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - write code for the software and responsible for its implementation
Quality Assurance - ensures the code is working optimally with no bugs by excecuting test plans
Priject manager - works to ensure the whole software development lifecycle is planned, created, tested, and delivered during a specific period

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDES - These are softwares that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code e.g., Visual Studio
VCS - These are tools used to track changes to source code and coordinate work among team members e.g Github
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements - software requirements may change during the development cycle which leads to scope creep and project delays. Effective communication can help us to overcome this challenge
Deadlines - With pressure to deliver software products on schedule, it can lead to rushed development and compromised quality. Using an agile methodology or prioritizing tasks can help with working and delivering the project within the set deadline.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit - testing individually components of the system to ensure each is working optimally
Intergration - testing interaction between various components to ensure that they're all working
System - testing the entire system as a single unit
Acceptance - testing the system against user requirements to ensure it meeds user requirements

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of feeding concise and clear information to AI to get the best and most results out of the prompt. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague - create a cover letter
Concise - Create a cover letter for applying for the role of a software engineer who has 3 years of experience, is adept in programming languages such as python, node C+, and Java. The cover letter should showcase the skills more and portray the software engineer as a professional.
